The input syntax of a grammar file is extremly simple.
The file is parsed line by line.
Every line is split into words (sequences of chars separated by whitespace).
All lines with the word "::=" as the second word are interpreted as rules,
all others are ignored (e.g. like these lines).
The nonterminal symbols are the set of all first words of a line forming a rule.
All other symbols occuring on a right side, are treated as terminal symbols.
The start symbol is the nonterminal of the first rule.


A very simple grammar for showing computation of nullables, first sets and follow sets

	Z	::=	d
 	Z	::=	X Y Z
 	X	::=	Y
 	X	::=	a
 	Y	::=	 
 	Y	::=	c
